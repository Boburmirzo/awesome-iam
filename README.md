# Awesome Identity and Access Management


## Meta

* [IAM definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_management)


## Authorization, ACLs

* [Zanzibar: Googleâ€™s Consistent, Global Authorization System](https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub48190) - scales to
trillions of access control lists and millions of authorization requests per second to support services used by
billions of people. It has maintained 95th-percentile latency of less than 10 milliseconds and availability of
greater than 99.999% over 3 years of production use.


## Multi-Factor Authentication

* [Beyond Passwords: 2FA, U2F and Google Advanced Protection](https://www.troyhunt.com/beyond-passwords-2fa-u2f-and-google-advanced-protection/) - An excellent walk-trough over all these technologies.
* [A Comparative Long-Term Study of Fallback Authentication](https://www.mobsec.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/media/mobsec/veroeffentlichungen/2019/02/20/usec2019-30-wip-fallback-long-term-study-finalv2.pdf) - Key take-away: `schemes based on email and SMS are more usable. Mechanisms based on designated trustees and personal knowledge questions, on the other hand, fall short, both in terms of convenience and efficiency.`
* [How effective is basic account hygiene at preventing hijacking](https://security.googleblog.com/2019/05/new-research-how-effective-is-basic.html) - Data shows 2FA blocks 100% of automated bot hacks.
